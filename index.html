        Hello! My name is Nick Pakalnins. I’m currently 30 years old and I
        reside in Hartland Michigan. I grew up playing hockey for 15 years and
        golf for 10 years. When not doing sports, I loved computer gaming and
        building computers. These passions helped introduce me to my first jobs,
        my first being working at a golf course during highschool. From there I
        transitioned into a more professional career working in logistics under
        a larger team environment after getting my associate’s degree. Logistics
        is a fantastic field to be in, but my passion was always computers. This
        led me to continue my education and enroll as a full time student at
        Oakland University to obtain a Bachelor’s Degree in Information
        Technology, with a professional track in Cybersecurity.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would like to continue my education and eventually get into the field
        of Cybersecurity. I have a year left of college and hope to find
        somewhere to intern at that will set me up on the right path for success
        for a future career in Cybersecurity. If you’re interested in all my
        previous careers, college experience, or to get to know me better, check

        Facts.
