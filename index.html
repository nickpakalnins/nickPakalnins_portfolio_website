          Hello! My name is Nick Pakalnins. I’m currently 30 years old and I
          reside in Hartland Michigan. I grew up playing hockey for 15 years and
          golf for 10 years. When not doing sports, I loved computer gaming and
          building computers. These passions helped introduce me to my first
          jobs, my first being working at a golf course during highschool. From
          there I transitioned into a more professional career working in
          logistics under a larger team environment after getting my associate’s
          degree. Logistics is a fantastic field to be in, but my passion was
          always computers. This led me to continue my education and enroll as a
          full time student at Oakland University to obtain a Bachelor’s Degree
          in Information Technology, with a professional track in Cybersecurity.

        "Everything in life is a mind game! Whenever we get swept under by
        life’s dramas, large and small, we are forgetting that no matter how bad
        the pain gets, no matter how harrowing the torture, all bad things end."

        I would like to continue my education and eventually get into the field
        of Cybersecurity. I have a year left of college and hope to find
        somewhere to intern at that will set me up on the right path for success
        for a future career in Cybersecurity. If you’re interested in all my
        previous careers, college experience, or to get to know me better, check
